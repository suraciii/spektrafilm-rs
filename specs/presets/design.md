# Preset design

- Vocabularies: a **preset** is a named parameter set — the user-facing one is a library document (`Built-in` compiled from the crate's `assets/presets`, `My Presets` read from `<config_dir>/presets`), while `data/presets/` keeps the upstream scope, the per-stock grain and coupler tables the runtime compiles in. A **look** is the content a preset owns: the look controls and their values. The terms *look preset* and *look document*, and a `looks` directory, must not appear.
- *Calibration* stays reserved for the Convert device-correction matrix and its worker. Names that mirror the pinned upstream (`apply_grain_preset`, `HALATION_PRESETS`, `v2_profile` and its values) keep their upstream spelling for parity traceability.
- The preset document, strict validation, resolution, capture, the library directory policy, discovery, name conflict rejection, and atomic writes belong to `core`. The Rust document type is `presets::Preset`, named after its module like `profile::Profile`; `LookParameters` remains the look payload.
- Built-in preset documents are repository files in `crates/spektrafilm-core/assets/presets`. The build must compile them in, so built-in listing and name resolution must not require a data directory, and packaged data directories must not carry copies.
- The library directory is `<config_dir>/presets`. The configuration directory policy is shared by the GUI and the CLI. `SPEKTRAFILM_CONFIG_DIR` must override it; there is no separate preset directory override. The library directory must not require a data directory.

## Names and groups

- A preset name is its identity. The document `name`, the file stem, and the selector must be the same string.
- The built-in documents form the `Built-in` group. The library directory forms the `My Presets` group.
- A name must be unique inside a group. Two built-in documents must not share a name, and two library documents must not share a name. The same name in both groups is valid.
- Name comparison must be case-insensitive, because some file systems resolve names without case.
- A name must be 1 to 64 characters. It must not contain `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, or control characters. It must not end with a period or with a carrier extension. It must not be a Windows reserved device name. These rules must hold on every platform, so a library can move between hosts.
- A library document must be named `<name>.toml` or `<name>.json`. A document whose `name` differs from its file stem must be a fault of that document.

## Discovery

- Discovery must not recurse. Only `.toml` and `.json` names must be documents; other entries must be ignored.
- An unreadable, unparsable, or invalid document must be a fault of that document. A per-document fault must not fail the scan or hide other entries.
- Name resolution must be exact. Without a prefix it must try `My Presets`, then `Built-in`, and then fail. The optional `user:` and `built-in:` prefixes must select one group.
- A bare name that resolves in `My Presets` while a built-in document carries the same name must report the resolved group. A shadowed built-in preset must stay reachable through its prefix.
- An unknown name must not trigger a filesystem search or a name-similarity match.

## Writes

- A missing library directory is an empty library, not a fault. Discovery must not create it; the first write must create it.
- A write must validate the complete document and resolve it before it replaces anything.
- A write must be atomic: write a temporary file in the library directory, then rename it. A failed write must retain the preceding document.
- Rename must change the document name and the file name together. A failed rename must leave the preceding document reachable under its old name.
- Import must not replace an existing name in `My Presets`. A conflict must be reported and must offer a renamed copy.
- Deleting or updating one document must not modify another document or a built-in document.

## Boundaries

- The GUI state keeps its complete-state contract. The panel width, the expanded state, and the last applied group and name belong to the versioned Rust extension and must not enter the Python-compatible sections. They must not change the meaning of a saved preset document.
- Modified detection compares the captured look controls and the film and print references with the applied document. It must not compare GUI state or a prepared runtime parameter tree.
- Built-in documents must stay read-only at run time. A user edit must produce a user document or no change. The `My Presets` group header must offer to reveal the library directory, because only user documents have a path.
- Live thumbnails, favorites, search, sorting options, collections, partial presets, inheritance, remote distribution, and scanning directories other than the library directory are outside this boundary.
